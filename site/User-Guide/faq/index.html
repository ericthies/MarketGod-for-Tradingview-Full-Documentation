<p>If you're experiencing this, you may be using the tool for the wrong reasons. -If you were confused as to why it has not sent a buy or sell signal, there are two options-
The buy and sell criteria was not triggered for a good reason. This is not a bug and you are misinterpreting the use of this tool.
You can choose to make your own buys and sells without using the indicator. Just now there is a good reason the alert didn?t fire</p>

<p><em>This is an easy fix and is typically caused by one of two issues</em>
1. Your alerts are outdated
   - When we publish a new update, we recommend you reset your alerts entirely. There are tools we recommend to make this an easier process, but it must be done. We ask this because Tradingview does not automatically update the alerts that are already set, when you add a newer version of the chart. So in essence, you're receiving a ghost alert from an older version of MarketGod</p>
<ol>
<li>You are using a very low time frame and the alerts are not confirmed when you check</li>
<li>MarketGod calculated IN REAL TIME. Meaning, the algo fires the signals when the current bar meets a preset criteria. On lower-time frames, this means there are likely calculations taking place that are right on the edge of hitting the pre-established criteria. We do this as an effort to justify our integrity in calculating without repainting. Our recommendation is the wait until the alert is CONFIRMED before evaluating the signal.-</li>

<h3 id="what-is-repainting">What is Repainting?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-repainting" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Repainting in the forex is a term that represents the trading platform indicator that repainting, meaning that indicator changes display on the chart as new price data (candles/bars) comes in. A repainting process shows that the indicator is displaying on the chart is highly accurate when it is not.</p>
<p><strong>Repainting indicator</strong>
" The repainting indicator is one that goes on changing in its value as an indicator repositioning its line at the point where the current price bar is forming. Such indicators take the help of future data to bring forth the values and signals for entry. In this way, repainting indicators ensure their exit and entry signals in the past look highly accurate and has zero error. The repainting indicator looks accurate on the chart but in real trading, they are not. Naturally, all Tradingview Programmers writing in pine-script will encounter questions regarding the validity of a given script, and how it handles repainting.For those who may be unfamiliar, here is the direct definition of repainting from the Tradingview Pine-Script Manual
Historical data does not include records of intra-bar movements of price; only open, high, low and close (OHLC). This leads to a script sometimes working differently on historical data and in real-time, where only the open price is known and where price will typically move many times before the real-time bar?s final high, low and close values are set after the real-time bar closes. Strategies using calc_on_every_tick=true. can trigger a repaint warning. Even strategy with parameter calc_on_every_tick = false may also be prone to repainting, but to a lesser degree. Using security for requesting data from a resolution higher than the resolution of the chart?s main symbol can also trigger repainting." </p>

<p>The signals are calculated by the most recent data available to the indicator on tradingview. If your chart is in relatime, it will send the alert in real time, meaning AS IT HAPPENS. If your chart is using signals that are delayed, MarketGod will calculate on the data made available time.
For Automation purposes, alerts and notifications send at the confirmation of the period closing with a given alert.
The different classical technical indicators comprised across the various MarketGod versions include magnitudes of various oscillators mainly comprised of MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Ichimoku, Gann Trend Analysis, Wyckoff Accum/Distribution Laws, Fibonacci calculated support/resistances, and more.</p>

<p>Seeing this or something similar below on your charts? It may happen when switching between 'plots' and 'labels' due to trading view's limitation on labels that are allowed on a given chart.
Simply put, the more authors with visuals on charts takes more server space and creates slower environments for users. So they limit the visuals to keep the servers as fast as traders need.
To solve this, we recommend changing the time frame, zooming in, or reducing the frequency in alerts by changing the filter settings to a higher number. You may also replace the label options with normal plots again.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-use-these-indicators-with-a-free-tradingview-account">Can I use these indicators with a Free Tradingview account<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-use-these-indicators-with-a-free-tradingview-account" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You can use all of our indicators with a free account, but keep in mind, with a free account you can only set up one live alert and only have up to three indicators on your chart active at one time. With a Pro account, you can set up multiple alerts and have up to 10 indicators on your chart at one time. I recommend a PRO+ account which will give you more than enough alerts and indicators on your chart. </p>
<h3 id="do-you-have-indicators-coded-for-mt4">Do you have indicators coded for MT4<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-have-indicators-coded-for-mt4" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Our indicators only work on TradingView at the moment. There are some plans to code them for MT4 and MT5 but we don't have an ETA on that.</p>
<p>What a lot of traders do is chart their trades with our indicators on TradingView and then place their trades on MT4. This is a very popular and preferred method since TradingView is known to have the best charting platform for Crypto, Stocks, and Forex and MT4 is well known for it's fast and easy trade execution platform.</p>
