##  General Suggested Uses

###  Which Timeframes to use MarketGod

MarketGod is designed to work across -every- timeframe on tradingview.com - that said, MarketGod is the most effective on the 1h, 4h, 1D timeframes. Other frames include (but are not limited to) the 3D, 1W, 2W & 1M timeframes depending on the traders preference

##  What Markets to Trade Using MarketGod

All Markets avialable on Tradingview.com

- Know that I built the tools primarily on Bitcoin vs. USD, because that's what I personally trade. That said, it DOES work on everything from equities, commodities, precious metals, indexes, funds, etc.
  
##  How to Proceed When a Buy or Sell Signal Appears

When following an alert you've received from one of our indicators, please ensure to verify its validity by making note of the environment the alert came from.

- Is the market volatile historically?
- How long ago did the alert fire?
- Are we near the higher range of a trading chart and in new territory?
- What time-frame did the alert fire on?

These are questions you need to be asking yourself prior to making an entry or exit into a position.

MarketGod Trading has issued multiple versions of the MarketGod Indicator. They are mostly similar in the process required once an alert is painted on the chart.

> "Simply buying and selling whenever the 5-minute MarketGod alert fires will likely put you in the negative side of things"
> Eric Thies, MarketGod Author

First off, know that these guidelines for steps taken after receiving an alert will absolutely differ person to person, and that we've designed this to be an add-on to confirm your already established trading process. Simply buying and selling whenever the 5-minute MarketGod alert fires will likely put you in the negative side of things for two reasons.

1. Increased exposure to market volatility over shorter period of time
2. Increased fees on the market you are trading. 1% over 100,000 trades add up quickly.

###  That said, following these outlined steps will likely end closer to positive with profits

Choose your preferred Market to trade. I use Bitcoin-USD but any you prefer is okay.
Once MarketGod is added to your charts, which we discussed above, we also recommend you add whichever indicators are preferred in your normal trading routine.

For us, that includes

- [RSI Divergence](https://www.tradingview.com/script/CaMohiJM-RSI-Divergence-Pine-v4/)
- [KDJ Indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/script/cTQfwzek-KDJ-Indicator-Pine-v4-KingThies/)
- [Bollinger Bands](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/bollingerbands/)
- [Keltner Channels](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/keltnerchannels/)
- [MarketGod Visuals](https://marketgodx.com/free-visual-add-on)

##  Tutorial: How to Trade With MarketGod

1. Assuming you're ready to go now, go ahead and set the alerts you need for MarketGod.
2. Wait for the Alerts to fire
3. Evaluate the market when the alert is received
4. Make trade at own risk

##  More Suggested Uses

- MarketGod will inevitably produce false positives. We've taken steps to reduce this but we highly suggest you add this as a component of your strategy, not an end all be all
- That said, please do not feel the need to fire a trade based solely on a marketgod signal, or to every signal it fires.
- MarketGod users should backtest their strategy using OHLC candles for best results
- Heikin Ashi candles were recommended in the past, and we have eliminated the need for them, meaning that traditional [candlestick](https://www.tradingview.com/scripts/candlestick/) inputs will yield the highest results.
- MarketGod will always give stronger alerts on higher TF's.
  - Example \#1 - If the 1-Day has fired a given signal and the 30 min or similar fire the opposite signal, know that the overall trend is still likely downward. Same concept applies to all timeframes on this tool.
  - Example \#2  - if the one-month get a signal over the one week it is absolutely worth listening to
- Reset all alerts every release that we put out. Each upgrade will require new sets of alerts to the tool and you were continue to receive the wrong words in future versions if you still have the words from the past

##  Additional Customization

Customize the indicator by adjusting the colors in the style pane. Additionally, users can change the plots into labels with the price of close added to them, or a few other label text options, listed in the 'inputs' panel, below the filter adjustments. Users can also opt to turn the strategy orders as well, as this version will have them printed.

Do not follow every alert. MarketGod is not designed as independent trading system. It's primary function is to alert you when a trade becomes potentially available and then you are to use your own strategy to make the decision

THIS MEANS TO ONLY USE MARKETGOD SIGNALS TO CONFIRM YOUR OWN PRECONCEIVED TRADING STRATEGY.

> The only thing that matters when it comes to financial trading is the money you bring back to your bank account. Winning % of trades is irrelevant.

The purpose of this strategy is not to achieve a high win percentage. The only thing that matters at the end of the day, is how much take home profit is brought in. A strategy with 70% win percent and 1% profit is useless compared to a 30% win rate and 10% profit take home. Read the strategy guide below to know best practices for interpreting these results.

## Studies Vs Strategies On Tradingview

[Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAaaiRVEcyw&t=4s)

[Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) differentiates strategies from studies in multiple ways that will be discussed below. If unfamiliar with the topic, know that Studies and Indicators are the same thing. Any Oscillator, Chart overlay, indicator, etc is a STUDY in technicality. Studies differ directly in that strategies are reactive to market environment and variables change given the situation, while studies will be more of a 'rinse, repeat' kind of set-up in which we can generate alerts from in which we use to apply a strategy to.

In essence, indicators are used to READ a market, while strategies are used to PLAY the market.

Indicators can not place orders or cannot be modified to fit a given environment. They will always give the same result at the same time with the same

[Tradingview's](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) native programming language Pine script, enables traders to develop algorithms they can apply as both indicators and strategies. Some users are unaware that indicators are completely unique from strategies and do not imply a given result from a reading or measurement taken. In their own functionality the call for an indicator over a strategy actually leads to almost a different process entirely for defining the price movement and what the intended result is. For one, indicators can establish alerts to be set that the trader will follow and receive on their mobile device when triggered. Strategies however, are limited in this ability and cannot fire alerts.

The challenge is that of the [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) users testing their strategies do not know how to interpret the results provided by Tradingview, which we aim to accomplish by showing specific examples and methods of testing, a standard of practice for our users and all Tradingview users to follow, along with various resources for reading further into this subject.

Some of the examples below are directly from the [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) blog, and resources provided by the PineCoders Community (Tradingview endorsed group & pine script MOD?s\). These items will be cited formally and linked.

The strategy report makes interpreting the success of a strategy relatively easy with its first look as we see above. The initial reporting metrics appear and logically make sense as well. But once we pivot over to the list of trades, [Tradingview has identified 4 components that are specified in this blog post](https://www.tradingview.com/blog/en/changes-in-the-backtesting-report-16416/)

## Strategy Settings and Associated Terms

| Terms 	| Definitions 	|  	
|-	|-	|-	|
| Profit (1)(from image) 	| This shows the profit per trade and the percentage gain or loss of that trade. 	|  	
| Cumulative Profit (2)(from Image) 	| This shows the total profits or losses of the strategy after closing a trade and the percentage gain or loss of the strategy over time. 	|  	
| Run-up (3)(from Image) 	| This shows the maximum possible profit of the trade according to the strategy as well as the maximum percentage gain. 	|  	
| Draw down (4) (from Image) 	| This shows the maximum possible loss of the trade according to the strategy as well as the maximum percentage loss. Definitions for Terms Used Across Tradingview Settings and Reporting Strategies It is important to be familiar with the terminology of the various settings and customization to parameters the trader has direct ability to change when back-testing. Many of these settings exponentially impact the result of th 	|  	

###  Slippage

Slippage refers to the conflict between the expected price of a deal and the price at which the trade is executed. Slippage can occur at any time but is most prevalent during periods of volatility when market orders are used. It can also occur when a large order is executed
but there isn't enough volume at the chosen price to maintain the current dictation /ask spread.

###  Pyramiding

Pyramiding involves adding to profitable views to take reward of an instrument that is performing well. It allows for large profits to be made as the status grows. Best of all, it does not have to increase jeopardy if performed properly.

###  Recommended Candle Type For Back Tests

Normal Candlesticks (OHLC) are the only input we recommend using for back-testing any Tradingview strategy.

Non-standard chart types can provide traders with alternative ways of interpreting price action, but they are not designed to test strategies or run automated traded systems where results depend on the ability to enter and exit trades at precise price levels at specific times, whether orders are issued manually or arithmetically. Ironically, the same characteristics that make non-standard chart types interesting from an analytical point of view also make them ill-suited to trade execution. Why? Because of the dislocation that a synthetic view of price action creates between its non-standard chart prices and real market prices at any given point in time. Switching from a non-standard chart price point into the market always entails a translation of time/price dimensions that results in uncertainty?and uncertainty concerning the level or the time at which orders are executed is detrimental to all strategies.

[Read why on this published post from PineCoders](https://marketgodx.com/why-backtest-with-candles)

Generally, these are pretty straightforward terms that are returned by the Trading View engine but you need to be able to understand what is going on with the numbers in it to understand how your orders succeeded in your given Trading approach and strategy. Below is an included glossary to reference the different meetings associated with each term when running your strategy and how you can use them to evaluate the performance.

##  Measuring The Performance Of Any Strategy

Understanding the definitions of these terms will ultimately add to your general understanding of your strategies performance performance

As you may know by now, back-testing a strategy is a key component in solidifying the base to your overall strategy, which makes the interpreting of its performance report all that more important.

The Strategy Performance Reports appear on the bottom of your [Tradingview](https://marketgodx.com/tradingview) charts in the management panel, with the tab location next to the Pine Script Terminal. The report itself contains

1. The Strategy Performance Overview
2. An in-depth Strategy Performance Summary
3. A List of Trades that were entered and traded

Many of these performance details are self explanatory, That said, one of the reasons we wanted to write this guide. was because there are a few generalizations and inaccurate assumptions made about the meaning of a few performance details to clear up. These are items to consider when interpreting them on a case by case basis. Below, we touch on the terms referenced and how they could be accurately interpreted on a general level.

***

##  Strategy Testing Results

###  The Overview Page

| # 	| Term 	| Definition 	|
|-	|-	|-	|
| 1 	| Net Profit 	| The total percent gained in a strategy. You want this to be as high as possible. Measured after fees 	|
| 2 	| Number of Trades Entered 	| Variable on your time frame traded and the frequency of trading. An adequate sample size in statistical textbooks would say aim for 30 or more for the period you are testing. Ultimately, the frequency is your preference on its result. 	|
| 3 	| Percent Profitable 	| Note, this is NOT how good or bad your strategy is. While ideally you want 40%+ win rate, there are cases in which you can win 80% of your trades but still lose money overall on the total return. The difference is in the scale and size of the wins and losses. if the weight of the losses is substantial enough, you can easily be in the red, despite winning the majority of your trades. 	|
| 4 	| Profit Factor 	| The profit factor is a simple ratio between the Gross Profit and Gross Loss values. 	|
| 5 	| Max Draw Down 	| A draw-down is the peak-to-trough decline during a specific recorded period of an investment, fund or commodity security. a draw-down is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the subsequent trough. 	|
| 6 	| Average Trade Size 	| Averaged out value of each confirmed trade 	|
| 7 	| Length of Bars 	| Length of average trade for given period 	|

###  The Performance Summary

Once you have run your backtesting strategy you will see a screen similar to this above the screen showing the results from the strategy approach. Shown here is the Performance Summary found on tab \#2 of the report.

## Strategy Specific Terms

Terms found on the 'Performance Summary' Page (middle page) on the Strategy Test results


In conclusion, the final tips we have for trading are listed below. This guide will ideally be added to over time so remember to check back from time to time in the event any items have changed.

##  Best Practices for Strategy Testing on Tradingview

1. Use OHLC (normal) candles
2.  Always make sure the 'recalculate on every tick' is UNCHECKED in the settings panel
3. Set slippage to reflect the fees you experience per trade
4. Remember that a high percentage of trade profitability DOES NOT ensure the strategy is solid. A strategy with 30% win-rate can yield higher return than one with 70%+. At the end of the day, the ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS YOUR TAKE HOME PROFIT.

##  Automation

**Plus Other External Tools**

Automation for our tool has always been the goal. In 2020 we are launching an offering through [Trendspider](https://www.marketgodx.com/trendspider), which will enable users of Trendspider to do so on their platform.
In addition to the Trendspider partnership, we are hoping to ultimately automate the entire process with a bot we offer straight from our site, but at this time, the project is only in infancy and not ready to be shared with our user base. Users can follow this project once we announce it officially towards the end of 2020.
At this time, to maximize your time spent on setting or changing alerts, automating your trading, or just adding more value to MarketGod, we recommend the following tools.
