3. Set the alerts for Buy and Sell, by selecting the MarketGod Indicator as the source of the alert (first drop down menu in the panel).
4. When the source is set to MarketGod, choose 'Buy Alert' or 'Sell Alert' from the menu afterward.
5. The frequency of the alerts should be set to your preference. We recommend the 'Once per bar close' option that sends an alert via SMS for email, without expiry, whenever the conditions are met.
