# SDR Call Script & Rules of Engagement

### Introduction

```Hey [First Name], this is [First Name, Last Name] from Rocket Lawyer, hope you're doing well.

I realize I'm calling out of the blue, but the reason for my call is to follow up on my last email, if you recall seeing that?

  <-------- PAUSE for answer and/or overcome objections  ---------->

The reason why I am reaching out to YOU specifically...

   1. I saw you're the [Benefits Manager] at [Company Name]
   2. Rocket Lawyer is currently offered at companies similar to yours like, as well as
      companies like Google, Uber, Sequoia, Twitter and more.
   3. One way to think of us would be 'TurboTax for Law'
   4 Our service is the ONLY 100% mobile first, cloud-based group legal platform in the world.

I was curious to see if you are available later this week or next for a brief demo?**

  <-------- PAUSE for answer and/or overcome objections  ---------->
```

## Elevator Pitch

### About Us…

```* Rocket Lawyer provides accessible legal technology company, NOT insurance or full benefit services.
* Rocket Lawyer Legal Benefits are built so employees of companies like yours can have 100% accessibility to any legal education or even full legal consulting our network can offer.
* Rocket Lawyer offers Universal Enrollment (covering 100% of your employees + their families) & makes it easy for  your employees to access an entire networks worth of legal education and process handy for life's everyday needs. For example, we see our services being utilized for events like

* landlord tenant issue
* managing personal finances
* answering real estate questions
* Marriage / divorce or adoptions
* Building wills and trusts, etc.

Surprisingly, We've seen by year 2 of program, we're averaging 25% engagement from entire organizations & the number will continue to grow as millennials and gen-z start in offices around the country.

PAUSE for answer and / or overcome objections
```
## The Hook

```Best of all - as a trust builder and given recent events - we're offering a 1-year No Cost Pilot
in advance and without obligation to your 2022 plan year. Which brings me to the reason for my
call today... could we find some time later this week to discuss this further?
```

### The Ask

```
Are you open to discuss later this week or next?
```

**Meeting Set!**

```* Wonderful, I've just sent over the calendar invite for [XYZ Date] did you get that? [Wait until they accept or confirm receipt]
If you have just another minute, I have just a few questions to ask you before I let you go.

> From everything I've mentioned so far, Do you have something already in place like Legal Insurance or any EAP?

1.  Our licensing is issued by total company headcount...What would be a ballpark number for [[XYZ]]?
2. One way to count this is by number of email domains issued, unless yours is composed of several? In most cases we find that the email addresses issued are similar to the overall usage of the legal benefits tool.

last question - since the meeting link I'll share with you is over zoom, what number should I call in the event we get disconnected during our meeting
```

## Voicemail Script

> "Hey [First Name] saw you're the [Title] at [Company Name], and hoped to follow up on my last note. 
> Curious if you're open to discuss and see for yourself, my name is [First, Last] with Rocket Lawyer. Feel free to reach me at [phone number]."
> > OR
>
> "Hey, this is [First, Last] from Rocket Lawyer, reason for my call is I saw you're the [Title] at [Company Name] and wanted to follow up on my note I sent over the other day. Should be in your inbox or in spam."

> - "not interested"
> - "take me off your list"
> - "unsubscribe"

### Quick Call Rebuttal after an eMail

```
Hey [First Name], this is [First, Last] from Rocket Lawyer. Just following up on our email exchange. I realize you mentioned you weren't interested, but before I close your account I had a couple questions, do you have a minute for me to explain?
```

## Text Message Template

```
Hey [First Name], this is [First, Last] from Rocket Lawyer, hope it's alright to send a quick TXT. [Insert quick ask, short as possible]. Let me know what works best! OR Thoughts?"`
```
---

## OBJECTION APPENDIX

### We already have something

```
Ah, Sounds like you may have an EAP or an existing Group Legal Plan?
```

### We already have an EAP

```
Without exception, all 400+ of our current customers offer an EAP, RL sits alongside it without disruption. Certainly not looking to replace what you currently have :) [CLOSE for Demo]
```

### Send me more info

```
Sure thing - I'll go ahead and send over a great Case Study, and I think you'll find the story compelling.
Mind if I also send over a calendar invite next week? I know it helps hold me accountable to follow up and see what you thought.
```

### Before I agree to a meeting, what's the price?

```
Our trust building period through 2021 offers a Pilot Period in advance and without obligation to renew for 2022. The Renewal Option depends on a few variables, typically ranges between $1 - $3 PEPM [CLOSE for Demo
```

### Bad time, you caught me running into a meeting

```
No sweat, I'll let you go. May I give you a call back at 4:30p or tomorrow at 8:30a?
```

### Not interested

```
Sounds like you may not handle employee benefits, is there someone else you'd recommend I reach out to?
```

### I don't have a calendar in front of me

```
No sweat, why don't I send over a modifiable calendar invite for _ , if that doesn't work you can adjust on your end [CLOSE for Demo].
```

### We offer [Insert Group Legal Plan], no complaints

```
OK, Legal Wellness is something you clearly value. Traditional Group Legal plans feature 5-7%
enrollment engagement rates on average.
A major benefit of our model, we see 25% active engagement by year 2 of the program.
Keep in mind, we're not insurance we're a technology company. We offer employees an On-Demand, online and mobile first platform to interact with. [CLOSE for Demo].
```

### We just rolled out an EAP / Legal Insurance

```
No sweat, we're not looking to replace your current offering. Rocket Lawyer can operate alongside and add on average 25% engagement.
```

### We already have an in-house legal team.

```
Pardon the confusion, RL is an employee benefit and not necessarily a legal tool for the company
```

### Our employees are too young/wouldn't use this

```
Now I know what you mean, and I myself found it surprising it's potentially the opposite - you see, a cloud based service is **all** they'd use & here's why:
Millennial employees are going through their "firsts" in life: first house, first marriage, first child, first aging parent, etc. many have few resources to turn to and naturally search the web. When they do, they find us. Let me send Sequoia's Case Study over..."
```

### We're sending out an employee survey

```
Survey Monkey is one of our clients! Full disclosure, "legal services" rank dead last in employee surveys.
Reason is, employees are used to the traditional expensive legal plans and EAPs.
This is exactly why we're offering a 1-year test drive. [CLOSE for Demo]
```

### My broker does this for me

```
`That's great, we work closely with a few brokers. Full disclosure, we don't pay brokers commissions like medical insurance carriers. Rocket Lawyer is a legal tech company. We've found, while brokers are a great sounding board they don't often have a financial incentive to work with us. With that, would you be open to a brief demo? If afterwards you're conceptually on board, happy to coordinate with you and your broker to vet the opportunity`.
```

### We have services through our PEO

```
Great to hear, we work with dozens of customers on PEOs like Insperity, ADP Total Source, TriNet, Paychex, etc. Best part is RL doesn't need to integrate with your HRIS or Benefits Admin systems, very turnkey. [CLOSE for Demo]
```

### Maybe next year

```
For clarity, this is something for 2022, we usually begin early - a year ahead - due to a two-tiered option. Following a demo and provided the program is appealing to XYZ, Inc. it would be up to XYZ, Inc. whether to 1) take advantage of a lengthy turnkey Free Trial or 2) simply begin to plan for 2022 adoption. In 20-30 minutes I could provide a demo and explain a little more. To date we haven't presented to XYZ, Inc. [CLOSE for Demo]"
```

### Sure, let's meet. Call me in two months.

```
Sounds great, happy to connect then! That said, we're of the mind, longer trial the better. Any chance you could squeeze me in the next couple of weeks. I have…
```

---

### But the Corona Virus!

```'
RL is a more valuable benefit than ever for employee peace of mind and it's 100% remote so holds its value no matter where your staff is working.
```

```
Taking care of employees' families is more important than ever and RL shines in easy self-serve elder care services: advanced health care directives, powers of attorney and family estate planning. More preparedness and peace of mind.
```

### Love to connect, but we're all set for 2020. Please reach out towards the end of the year to discuss for 2021

```
For clarity, this is something for 2021, we usually begin early - a year ahead - due to a two-tiered option. Following a demo and provided the program is appealing to XYZ, Inc. it would be up to XYZ, Inc. whether to 1) take advantage of a lengthy turnkey Free Trial or 2) simply begin to plan for 2020 adoption. In 20-30 minutes I could provide a demo and explain a little more. To date we haven't presented to XYZ, Inc. [CLOSE for Demo]
```

### Sends Declined calendar invitation

```
Best Case / Worst Case : This is an exploratory demonstration of Rocket Lawyer, best case scenario, you love the product and want to pilot RL in a free trial.
Worst case, you decide it isn't for you and you walk away, no harm done.
```
