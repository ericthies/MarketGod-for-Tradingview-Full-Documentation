# About  

## Intro to MarketGod Trading 

***

The MarketGod Indicator is published on Tradingview.com using the Pinescript v4 programming language. We have operated privately since 2018 and is utilized by 2500 users around the globe. After launching in late 2018 as a free tool on the Tradingview platform, it was quickly realized the strategy would become one of the most infamous and well regarded across various online trading niches. 

After quickly growing into one of Tradingview's most popular tools available in their public indicator library, author Eric Thies (aka KingThies on Twitter / KingThies_ on tradingview) realized that the rapid growth and success of the tool would require an unprecedented amount of time toward dedicated development and active management. The decision was made to convert the script and its access into a private offering, and the idea of our company, MarketGod Trading was born. 

Due to limitations of Tradingview's platform, users may notice inconsistencies across the web on the Titles, Descriptions, Versioning and Details of our offerings. We understand any confusion and are actively working with Tradingview and various sources to consolidate everything people perceive, hear and see of our brand.
Our Company is MarketGod Trading LLC

Our Brand is the **MarketGod Buy +  Sell Indicator for Tradingview**   

Our Offerings/Products Include:

-  MarketGod for Tradingview [study]
-  MarketGod for Tradingview [strategy] 
  
Prior to consolidating our scripts into the two products above, we offered 13 tools that were published by our old Tradingview account, TVMarketGod. We have since changed our account to a new Tradingview Account, MarketGodx.
