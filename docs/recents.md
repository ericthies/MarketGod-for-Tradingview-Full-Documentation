## MACD

### MACD Introduction

Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following oscillator technique which uses 2 exponential moving averages and was developed by Gerald Appel in the late 1970’s. As all momentum indicators, the MACD gives an idea about the general direction of an asset’s price.  

### MACD Calculation

The MACD line is the result of subtracting the long term 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from the short term 12-period EMA. An additional line called the “signal line” is plotted on the top of the MACD line. The “signal line” is nothing but a 9-period EMA of the MACD and serves as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the asset whenever the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell the asset whenever the MACD crosses below its signal line. The difference between the MACD line and the signal line is usually shown through bar histograms, where positive values indicate an upward trend, while negative values indicate a downward trend. The size of the bar histogram which reflects the distance between the MACD line and the signal line gives an indication about the velocity of the movement. Crossovers of the centerline of the histogram indicate buy and sell signals. Crossovers towards the positive side of the histogram indicate a buy signal while a crossover towards the negative side indicates a sell signal. 

### MACD Application in Trading

One of the most popular ways to use the MACD histogram is to trade divergence. However, the divergence trade is not always very accurate; in fact, its success rate is below 50%. In order to explore a more logical way of trading the MACD divergence we look at using the MACD histogram for trade entry and trade exit signals (instead of focusing on entry only), this gives traders a unique edge to take advantage of such a strategy.

## Stochastic

### Stochastic Introduction

Most available financial resources state that the stochastic indicator has been developed by Dr. George Lane during his time working for Investment Educators in the 1950’s. However, some sources claim that the oscillator was a discovery made by Ralph Dyant, then head of Investment Educators, or even by some other colleague at the firm or one of their relatives. The stochastic compares a stock closing price to its price range over a certain period of time (analysts conventionally use 14 periods as the default setting for the stochastic oscillator).   
Depending on the analysis objectives, the time period could be set as days, weeks, or even months for an analyst willing to get a long-term view. A trader can also use an intraday timeframe.

### Stochastic Summary

The stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator using support and resistance levels and refers to the position of the closing price in relationship to the price range over a period of time. It is calculated as the difference between the close and the low, divided by the price range (the difference between the high and low over a certain period of time). The result is noted %K, and for a 14-period %K, an analyst would use the most recent close and the absolute high and low over the 14-period preceding the analysis. Thus, the indicator takes a value between 0 and 1 and is expressed in percentage points. An additional line is plotted against %K acting as a trigger line and denoted %D.  %D is just the 3-day simple moving average of %K.  

### Stochastic Calculation & Interpretation

The stochastic oscillator measures the position of the close relative to the high-low range over the chosen timeframe. A reading over 50% indicates that the close is somewhere in the upper half of the high-low range, whereas a reading under 50% indicates that the close is somewhere in the lower half of that range. A stochastic value over 80% indicates that the security is overbought and a crossover below that threshold represents a potential sell signal while a value below 20% indicates that the security is oversold and a crossover above that threshold indicates a potential buy signal. However, this indicator needs to be considered in conjunction with other indicators to provide meaningful insights. In fact, a reading over 80% could not be considered as a sell signal at all times, as securities can, at times, keep being overbought for a long period during a sustained uptrend.

## Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands consists of a center line representing the moving average of a security’s price over a certain period, and two additional parallel lines (called the trading bands) one of which is just the moving average plus k-times the standard deviation over the selected time frame, and the other being the moving average minus k-times the standard deviation over that same timeframe. This technique has been developed in the 1980’s by John Bollinger, who lately registered the terms “Bollinger Bands” as a U.S. trademark in 2011. Technical analysts typically use 20 periods and k = 2 as default settings to build Bollinger Bands, while they can choose a simple or exponential moving average. Bollinger Bands provide a relative definition of high and low prices of a security. When the security is trading within the upper band, the price is considered high, while it is considered low when the security is trading within the lower band.  
There is no general consensus on the use of Bollinger Bands among traders. Some traders see a buy signal when the price hits the lower Bollinger Band and close their position when the price hits the moving average. Some others buy when the price crosses over the upper band and sell when the price crosses below the lower band. We can see here two opposing interpretations based on different rationales, depending whether we are in a reversal or continuation pattern. Another interesting feature of the Bollinger Bands is that they give an indication of the volatility levels; a widening gap between the upper and lower bands indicates an increasing volatility, while a narrowing band indicates a decreasing volatility. Moreover, when the bands have an almost flat slope (parallel to the x-axis) the price will generally oscillate between the bands as if trading through a channel.

## Keltner Channels

Keltner Channels aka Kelts were first described by a Chicago grain trader called Chester W. Keltner in his 1960 book How to Make Money in Commodities. Though Keltner claimed no ownership of the original idea and simply called it the ten-day moving average trading rule, his name was applied by those who heard of this concept through his books.
 Similarly to the Bollinger Bands, Keltner channel is a technical analysis tool based on three parallel lines. In fact, the Keltner indicator consists of a central moving average in addition to channel lines spread above and below it. The central line represents a 10-day simple moving average of what Chester W. Keltner called typical price. The typical price is defined as the average of the high, low and close. The distance between the central line and the upper, or lower line, is equivalent to the simple moving average of the preceding 10 days' trading ranges.
One way to interpret the Keltner Channel would be to consider the price breakouts outside of the channel. A trader would track price movement and consider any close above the upper line as a strong buy signal. Equivalently, any close below the lower line would be considered a strong sell signal. The trader would follow the trend emphasized by the indicator while complementing his analysis with the use of other indicators as well. However, the breakout method only works well when the market moves from a range-bound setting to an established trend. In a trendless configuration, the Keltner Channel is better used as an overbought/oversold indicator. Thus, as the price breaks out below the lower band, a trader waits for the next close inside the Keltner Channel and considers this price behavior as an oversold situation indicating a potential buy signal. Similarly, as the price breaks out above the upper band, the trader waits for the next close inside the Keltner Channel and considers this price behaviour as an overbought situation indicating a potential sell signal. By waiting for the price to close within the Channel, the trader avoids getting caught in a real upside or downside breakout.

## Accumulation/Distribution

The Accumulation/Distribution Line is a technical analysis indicator that assesses whether a security is being accumulated or distributed by using both price and volume. It is a volume-based indicator whose main objective is to measure underlying supply and demand. The indicator achieves this goal by attempting to determine whether traders buy (accumulation) or sell (distribution) the asset. The Accumulation/Distribution (A/D) indicator provides insight about the strength of a trend. In fact, the A/D measure identifies the divergences between the stock price and the volume flow. In practice, a rising price accompanied by a declining indicator indicates that the buying volume (accumulation) is not sufficient to support the price rise and that a price decline is around the corner. The price and volume divergences are assessed in order to affirm a current trend or anticipate a future reversal. 

### AD Calculation

Accumulation/Distribution = ((Close – Low) – (High – Close)) / (High – Low) * Period Volume 
[(Close  -  Low) - (High - Close)]/(High - Low) = Money Flow Multiplier 

The main variable affecting the A/D to increase or decrease is the Money Flow Multiplier. The Money Flow Multiplier is affected by the relationship between a period’s closing price and the period’s high/low range. Looking at the Money Flow Multiplier formula we can conclude that its value lies between -1 and 1. When the price closes in the upper half of the high/low range, the Money Flow Multiplier will be closer to 1 signaling a high buying pressure. Equivalently, when the price closes in the lower half of the high/low range, the Money Flow Multiplier will be closer to -1 signaling a high selling pressure. A/D rises with a highly positive multiplier combined with a strong volume and falls with a highly negative multiplier combined with a strong volume. Thus, the A/D line becomes a sensor of buying (accumulation) and selling (distribution) pressure, making it a helpful tool in confirming trends and anticipating reversals.

## Ichimoku

The Ichimoku Kinko Hyo is a technical analysis indicator based on candlesticks charting. The technique aims at improving the accuracy of forecast price moves. It was published by Japanese journalist called Goichi Hosoda in the late 1960s who spent 30 years working on it before releasing it to the general public. 
Ichimoku is a trend identification system based on a moving-average. The fact that it contains more data points than standard candlesticks makes its insights clearer in terms of potential price action. The Ichimoku plots moving averages in a way which is sensibly different from other techniques. In fact, Ichimoku’s lines are constructed using the 50% point of the highs as opposed to the candle’s closing price. Moreover, similarly to William Delbert Grann’s trading ideas, Ichioku takes into consideration the factor of time in addition to the price action. 
The indicator has been subsequently improved and integrated by three other theories: Time Theory, Wave Movement Theory, and Target Price Theory. 

**There are five key components to the Ichimoku indicator:**

### Tenkan-sen

* The tenkan-sen, or conversion line, is calculated by adding the highest high and the highest low over the past nine periods and then dividing the result by two. The resulting line represents a key support and resistance level, as well as a signal line for reversals
  
### Kijun-sen

* The kijun-sen, or base line, is calculated by adding the highest high and the lowest low over the past 26 periods and dividing the result by two. The resulting line represents a key support and resistance level, a confirmation of a trend change, and can be used as a trailing stop-loss point

### Senkou Span A

* The senkou span A, or leading span A, is calculated by adding the tenkan-sen and the kijun-sen, dividing the result by two, and then plotting the result 26 periods ahead. The resulting line forms one edge of the kumo - or cloud - that's used to identify future areas of support and resistance
  
### Senkou Span B

* The senkou span B, or leading span B, is calculated by adding the highest high and the lowest low over the past 52 periods, dividing it by two, and then plotting the result 26 periods ahead. The resulting line forms the other edge of the kumo that's used to identify future areas of support and resistance
  
### Chikou Span

* The chikou span, or lagging span, is the current period's closing price plotted 26 days back on the chart. This line is used to show possible areas of support and resistance
