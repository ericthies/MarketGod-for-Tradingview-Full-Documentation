Other frames include (but are not limited to) the 3D, 1W, 2W & 1M timeframes depending on the traders preference What Markets to Trade Using MarketGod All Markets avialable on Tradingview.com Know that I built the tools primarily on Bitcoin vs. USD, because that's what I personally trade. That said, it DOES work on everything from equities, commodities, precious metals, indexes, funds, etc. How to Proceed When a Buy or Sell Signal Appears When following an alert you've received from one of our indicators, please ensure to verify its validity by making note of the environment the alert came from. Is the market volatile historically? How long ago did the alert fire? Are we near the higher range of a trading chart and in new territory? What time-frame did the alert fire on? These are questions you need to be asking yourself prior to making an entry or exit into a position. MarketGod Trading has issued multiple versions of the MarketGod Indicator. They are mostly similar in the process required once an alert is painted on the chart. \"Simply buying and selling whenever the 5-minute MarketGod alert fires will likely put you in the negative side of things\" Eric Thies, MarketGod Author First off, know that these guidelines for steps taken after receiving an alert will absolutely differ person to person, and that we've designed this to be an add-on to confirm your already established trading process. Simply buying and selling whenever the 5-minute MarketGod alert fires will likely put you in the negative side of things for two reasons. Increased exposure to market volatility over shorter period of time Increased fees on the market you are trading. 1% over 100,000 trades add up quickly. That said, following these outlined steps will likely end closer to positive with profits Choose your preferred Market to trade. I use Bitcoin-USD but any you prefer is okay. Once MarketGod is added to your charts, which we discussed above, we also recommend you add whichever indicators are preferred in your normal trading routine. For us, that includes RSI Divergence KDJ Indicator Bollinger Bands Keltner Channels MarketGod Visuals Tutorial: How to Trade With MarketGod Assuming you're ready to go now, go ahead and set the alerts you need for MarketGod. Wait for the Alerts to fire Evaluate the market when the alert is received Make trade at own risk More Suggested Uses MarketGod will inevitably produce false positives. We've taken steps to reduce this but we highly suggest you add this as a component of your strategy, not an end all be all That said, please do not feel the need to fire a trade based solely on a marketgod signal, or to every signal it fires. MarketGod users should backtest their strategy using OHLC candles for best results Heikin Ashi candles were recommended in the past, and we have eliminated the need for them, meaning that traditional candlestick inputs will yield the highest results. MarketGod will always give stronger alerts on higher TF's. Example #1 - If the 1-Day has fired a given signal and the 30 min or similar fire the opposite signal, know that the overall trend is still likely downward. Same concept applies to all timeframes on this tool. Example #2 - if the one-month get a signal over the one week it is absolutely worth listening to Reset all alerts every release that we put out. Each upgrade will require new sets of alerts to the tool and you were continue to receive the wrong words in future versions if you still have the words from the past Additional Customization Customize the indicator by adjusting the colors in the style pane. Additionally, users can change the plots into labels with the price of close added to them, or a few other label text options, listed in the 'inputs' panel, below the filter adjustments. Users can also opt to turn the strategy orders as well, as this version will have them printed. Do not follow every alert. MarketGod is not designed as independent trading system. It's primary function is to alert you when a trade becomes potentially available and then you are to use your own strategy to make the decision THIS MEANS TO ONLY USE MARKETGOD SIGNALS TO CONFIRM YOUR OWN PRECONCEIVED TRADING STRATEGY. MarketGod for Tradingview Strategy Results and Performance Strategy Test Results of MarketGodx\ufffd Parameters Results The parameters for this are as follows $10,000 capital Trading 10% equity each trade Measured since start of 2019 Stop loss and TP on at 25% take profit, 5% SL .1% Commission and 1 bar slippage 36% profit over this period of time 381 Trades made 39% win rate 1.26 trade profitability 6% Draw-Down <b></b> The only thing that matters when it comes to financial trading is the money you bring back to your bank account. Winning % of trades is irrelevant. The purpose of this strategy is not to achieve a high win percentage. The only thing that matters at the end of the day, is how much take home profit is brought in. A strategy with 70% win percent and 1% profit is useless compared to a 30% win rate and 10% profit take home. Read the strategy guide below to know best practices for interpreting these results. Studies Vs Strategies On Tradingview Youtube Tutorial Tradingview differentiates strategies from studies in multiple ways that will be discussed below. If unfamiliar with the topic, know that Studies and Indicators are the same thing. Any Oscillator, Chart overlay, indicator, etc is a STUDY in technicality. Studies differ directly in that strategies are reactive to market environment and variables change given the situation, while studies will be more of a 'rinse, repeat' kind of set-up in which we can generate alerts from in which we use to apply a strategy to. In essence, indicators are used to READ a market, while strategies are used to PLAY the market. Indicators can not place orders or cannot be modified to fit a given environment. They will always give the same result at the same time with the same Tradingview's native programming language Pine script, enables traders to develop algorithms they can apply as both indicators and strategies. Some users are unaware that indicators are completely unique from strategies and do not imply a given result from a reading or measurement taken. In their own functionality the call for an indicator over a strategy actually leads to almost a different process entirely for defining the price movement and what the intended result is. For one, indicators can establish alerts to be set that the trader will follow and receive on their mobile device when triggered. Strategies however, are limited in this ability and cannot fire alerts. The challenge is that of the Tradingview users testing their strategies do not know how to interpret the results provided by Tradingview, which we aim to accomplish by showing specific examples and methods of testing, a standard of practice for our users and all Tradingview users to follow, along with various resources for reading further into this subject. Some of the examples below are directly from the Tradingview blog, and resources provided by the PineCoders Community (Tradingview endorsed group & pine script MOD?s). These items will be cited formally and linked. The strategy report makes interpreting the success of a strategy relatively easy with its first look as we see above. The initial reporting metrics appear and logically make sense as well. But once we pivot over to the list of trades, Tradingview has identified 4 components that are specified in this blog post Strategy Settings and Associated Terms | Terms | Definitions | |- |- |- | | Profit (1)(from image) | This shows the profit per trade and the percentage gain or loss of that trade. | | Cumulative Profit (2)(from Image) | This shows the total profits or losses of the strategy after closing a trade and the percentage gain or loss of the strategy over time. | | Run-up (3)(from Image) | This shows the maximum possible profit of the trade according to the strategy as well as the maximum percentage gain. | | Draw down (4) (from Image) | This shows the maximum possible loss of the trade according to the strategy as well as the maximum percentage loss. Definitions for Terms Used Across Tradingview Settings and Reporting Strategies It is important to be familiar with the terminology of the various settings and customization to parameters the trader has direct ability to change when back-testing. Many of these settings exponentially impact the result of th | Slippage Slippage refers to the conflict between the expected price of a deal and the price at which the trade is executed. Slippage can occur at any time but is most prevalent during periods of volatility when market orders are used. It can also occur when a large order is executed but there isn't enough volume at the chosen price to maintain the current dictation /ask spread. Pyramiding Pyramiding involves adding to profitable views to take reward of an instrument that is performing well. It allows for large profits to be made as the status grows. Best of all, it does not have to increase jeopardy if performed properly. Recommended Candle Type For Back Tests Normal Candlesticks (OHLC) are the only input we recommend using for back-testing any Tradingview strategy. Non-standard chart types can provide traders with alternative ways of interpreting price action, but they are not designed to test strategies or run automated traded systems where results depend on the ability to enter and exit trades at precise price levels at specific times, whether orders are issued manually or arithmetically. Ironically, the same characteristics that make non-standard chart types interesting from an analytical point of view also make them ill-suited to trade execution. Why? Because of the dislocation that a synthetic view of price action creates between its non-standard chart prices and real market prices at any given point in time. Switching from a non-standard chart price point into the market always entails a translation of time/price dimensions that results in uncertainty?and uncertainty concerning the level or the time at which orders are executed is detrimental to all strategies. Read why on this published post from PineCoders Generally, these are pretty straightforward terms that are returned by the Trading View engine but you need to be able to understand what is going on with the numbers in it to understand how your orders succeeded in your given Trading approach and strategy. Below is an included glossary to reference the different meetings associated with each term when running your strategy and how you can use them to evaluate the performance. Measuring The Performance Of Any Strategy Understanding the definitions of these terms will ultimately add to your general understanding of your strategies performance performance As you may know by now, back-testing a strategy is a key component in solidifying the base to your overall strategy, which makes the interpreting of its performance report all that more important. The Strategy Performance Reports appear on the bottom of your Tradingview charts in the management panel, with the tab location next to the Pine Script Terminal. The report itself contains The Strategy Performance Overview An in-depth Strategy Performance Summary A List of Trades that were entered and traded Many of these performance details are self explanatory, That said, one of the reasons we wanted to write this guide. was because there are a few generalizations and inaccurate assumptions made about the meaning of a few performance details to clear up. These are items to consider when interpreting them on a case by case basis. Below, we touch on the terms referenced and how they could be accurately interpreted on a general level. Strategy Testing Results The Overview Page # Term Definition 1 Net Profit The total percent gained in a strategy. You want this to be as high as possible. Measured after fees 2 Number of Trades Entered Variable on your time frame traded and the frequency of trading. An adequate sample size in statistical textbooks would say aim for 30 or more for the period you are testing. Ultimately, the frequency is your preference on its result. 3 Percent Profitable Note, this is NOT how good or bad your strategy is. While ideally you want 40%+ win rate, there are cases in which you can win 80% of your trades but still lose money overall on the total return. The difference is in the scale and size of the wins and losses. if the weight of the losses is substantial enough, you can easily be in the red, despite winning the majority of your trades. 4 Profit Factor The profit factor is a simple ratio between the Gross Profit and Gross Loss values. 5 Max Draw Down A draw-down is the peak-to-trough decline during a specific recorded period of an investment, fund or commodity security. a draw-down is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the subsequent trough. 6 Average Trade Size Averaged out value of each confirmed trade 7 Length of Bars Length of average trade for given period The Performance Summary Once you have run your backtesting strategy you will see a screen similar to this above the screen showing the results from the strategy approach. Shown here is the Performance Summary found on tab #2 of the report. Strategy Specific Terms Terms found on the 'Performance Summary' Page (middle page) on the Strategy Test results | # | Term | Definition | |:-: |- |- |- |- |- | | 1 | Net Profit | The total percent gained in a strategy. You want this to be as high as possible. Measured after fees | | 2 | Number of Trades Entered | Variable on your time frame traded and the frequency of trading.

This guide will ideally be added to over time so remember to check back from time to time in the event any items have changed. Best Practices for Strategy Testing on Tradingview Use OHLC (normal) candles Always make sure the 'recalculate on every tick' is UNCHECKED in the settings panel Set slippage to reflect the fees you experience per trade Remember that a high percentage of trade profitability DOES NOT ensure the strategy is solid. A strategy with 30% win-rate can yield higher return than one with 70%+. At the end of the day, the ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS YOUR TAKE HOME PROFIT.

Why did my indicator not send a buy or a sell when the market price changed? If you're experiencing this, you may be using the tool for the wrong reasons. -If you were confused as to why it has not sent a buy or sell signal, there are two options- The buy and sell criteria was not triggered for a good reason. This is not a bug and you are misinterpreting the use of this tool. You can choose to make your own buys and sells without using the indicator. Just now there is a good reason the alert didn?t fire A MarketGod Alert was sent to my phone / email but nothing painted on the chart when I looked This is an easy fix and is typically caused by one of two issues 1. Your alerts are outdated - When we publish a new update, we recommend you reset your alerts entirely. There are tools we recommend to make this an easier process, but it must be done. We ask this because Tradingview does not automatically update the alerts that are already set, when you add a newer version of the chart. So in essence, you're receiving a ghost alert from an older version of MarketGod You are using a very low time frame and the alerts are not confirmed when you check MarketGod calculated IN REAL TIME. Meaning, the algo fires the signals when the current bar meets a preset criteria. On lower-time frames, this means there are likely calculations taking place that are right on the edge of hitting the pre-established criteria. We do this as an effort to justify our integrity in calculating without repainting. Our recommendation is the wait until the alert is CONFIRMED before evaluating the signal.- What is Repainting? Repainting in the forex is a term that represents the trading platform indicator that repainting, meaning that indicator changes display on the chart as new price data (candles/bars) comes in. A repainting process shows that the indicator is displaying on the chart is highly accurate when it is not. Repainting indicator \" The repainting indicator is one that goes on changing in its value as an indicator repositioning its line at the point where the current price bar is forming. Such indicators take the help of future data to bring forth the values and signals for entry. In this way, repainting indicators ensure their exit and entry signals in the past look highly accurate and has zero error. The repainting indicator looks accurate on the chart but in real trading, they are not. Naturally, all Tradingview Programmers writing in pine-script will encounter questions regarding the validity of a given script, and how it handles repainting.For those who may be unfamiliar, here is the direct definition of repainting from the Tradingview Pine-Script Manual Historical data does not include records of intra-bar movements of price; only open, high, low and close (OHLC). This leads to a script sometimes working differently on historical data and in real-time, where only the open price is known and where price will typically move many times before the real-time bar?s final high, low and close values are set after the real-time bar closes. Strategies using calc_on_every_tick=true. can trigger a repaint warning. Even strategy with parameter calc_on_every_tick = false may also be prone to repainting, but to a lesser degree. Using security for requesting data from a resolution higher than the resolution of the chart?s main symbol can also trigger repainting.\" Does MarketGod Repaint? No. What Is MarketGod and MarketGod Trading? MarketGod Trading is an organization committed to better enabling retail traders on their road to success.

Sometimes I use the BB% Oscillator When does MarketGod calculate its signals The signals are calculated by the most recent data available to the indicator on tradingview.

For Automation purposes, alerts and notifications send at the confirmation of the period closing with a given alert. The different classical technical indicators comprised across the various MarketGod versions include magnitudes of various oscillators mainly comprised of MACD, RSI, Stochastic, Ichimoku, Gann Trend Analysis, Wyckoff Accum/Distribution Laws, Fibonacci calculated support/resistances, and more. The Lock on My Indicator Access is Still Red Still try adding the tools after refreshing the browser. The red lock updates once you've accessed a tool, not just gained access to it. Why are my labels only showing up on part of the chart? Seeing this or something similar below on your charts? It may happen when switching between 'plots' and 'labels' due to trading view's limitation on labels that are allowed on a given chart. Simply put, the more authors with visuals on charts takes more server space and creates slower environments for users. So they limit the visuals to keep the servers as fast as traders need. To solve this, we recommend changing the time frame, zooming in, or reducing the frequency in alerts by changing the filter settings to a higher number. You may also replace the label options with normal plots again. Can I use these indicators with a Free Tradingview account You can use all of our indicators with a free account, but keep in mind, with a free account you can only set up one live alert and only have up to three indicators on your chart active at one time. With a Pro account, you can set up multiple alerts and have up to 10 indicators on your chart at one time. I recommend a PRO+ account which will give you more than enough alerts and indicators on your chart. Do you have indicators coded for MT4 Our indicators only work on TradingView at the moment. There are some plans to code them for MT4 and MT5 but we don't have an ETA on that. What a lot of traders do is chart their trades with our indicators on TradingView and then place their trades on MT4. This is a very popular and preferred method since TradingView is known to have the best charting platform for Crypto, Stocks, and Forex and MT4 is well known for it's fast and easy trade execution platform.

They are mostly similar in the process required once an alert is painted on the chart. \"Simply buying and selling whenever the 5-minute MarketGod alert fires will likely put you in the negative side of things\" Eric Thies, MarketGod Author First off, know that these guidelines for steps taken after receiving an alert will absolutely differ person to person, and that we've designed this to be an add-on to confirm your already established trading process. Simply buying and selling whenever the 5-minute MarketGod alert fires will likely put you in the negative side of things for two reasons.

MarketGod users should backtest their strategy using OHLC candles for best results Heikin Ashi candles were recommended in the past, and we have eliminated the need for them, meaning that traditional candlestick inputs will yield the highest results. MarketGod will always give stronger alerts on higher TF's.

If unfamiliar with the topic, know that Studies and Indicators are the same thing. Any Oscillator, Chart overlay, indicator, etc is a STUDY in technicality. Studies differ directly in that strategies are reactive to market environment and variables change given the situation, while studies will be more of a 'rinse, repeat' kind of set-up in which we can generate alerts from in which we use to apply a strategy to. In essence, indicators are used to READ a market, while strategies are used to PLAY the market. Indicators can not place orders or cannot be modified to fit a given environment. They will always give the same result at the same time with the same Tradingview's native programming language Pine script, enables traders to develop algorithms they can apply as both indicators and strategies. Some users are unaware that indicators are completely unique from strategies and do not imply a given result from a reading or measurement taken. In their own functionality the call for an indicator over a strategy actually leads to almost a different process entirely for defining the price movement and what the intended result is. For one, indicators can establish alerts to be set that the trader will follow and receive on their mobile device when triggered. Strategies however, are limited in this ability and cannot fire alerts. The challenge is that of the Tradingview users testing their strategies do not know how to interpret the results provided by Tradingview, which we aim to accomplish by showing specific examples and methods of testing, a standard of practice for our users and all Tradingview users to follow, along with various resources for reading further into this subject. Some of the examples below are directly from the Tradingview blog, and resources provided by the PineCoders Community (Tradingview endorsed group & pine script MOD?s). These items will be cited formally and linked. The strategy report makes interpreting the success of a strategy relatively easy with its first look as we see above.

Non-standard chart types can provide traders with alternative ways of interpreting price action, but they are not designed to test strategies or run automated traded systems where results depend on the ability to enter and exit trades at precise price levels at specific times, whether orders are issued manually or arithmetically. Ironically, the same characteristics that make non-standard chart types interesting from an analytical point of view also make them ill-suited to trade execution. Why? Because of the dislocation that a synthetic view of price action creates between its non-standard chart prices and real market prices at any given point in time. Switching from a non-standard chart price point into the market always entails a translation of time/price dimensions that results in uncertainty?and uncertainty concerning the level or the time at which orders are executed is detrimental to all strategies.

A repainting process shows that the indicator is displaying on the chart is highly accurate when it is not. Repainting indicator \" The repainting indicator is one that goes on changing in its value as an indicator repositioning its line at the point where the current price bar is forming. Such indicators take the help of future data to bring forth the values and signals for entry. In this way, repainting indicators ensure their exit and entry signals in the past look highly accurate and has zero error. The repainting indicator looks accurate on the chart but in real trading, they are not. Naturally, all Tradingview Programmers writing in pine-script will encounter questions regarding the validity of a given script, and how it handles repainting.For those who may be unfamiliar, here is the direct definition of repainting from the Tradingview Pine-Script Manual Historical data does not include records of intra-bar movements of price; only open, high, low and close (OHLC). This leads to a script sometimes working differently on historical data and in real-time, where only the open price is known and where price will typically move many times before the real-time bar?s final high, low and close values are set after the real-time bar closes. Strategies using calc_on_every_tick=true. can trigger a repaint warning. Even strategy with parameter calc_on_every_tick = false may also be prone to repainting, but to a lesser degree.

If your chart is in relatime, it will send the alert in real time, meaning AS IT HAPPENS. If your chart is using signals that are delayed, MarketGod will calculate on the data made available time. For Automation purposes, alerts and notifications send at the confirmation of the period closing with a given alert.

It may happen when switching between 'plots' and 'labels' due to trading view's limitation on labels that are allowed on a given chart. Simply put, the more authors with visuals on charts takes more server space and creates slower environments for users. So they limit the visuals to keep the servers as fast as traders need. To solve this, we recommend changing the time frame, zooming in, or reducing the frequency in alerts by changing the filter settings to a higher number. You may also replace the label options with normal plots again.","title":"Why are my labels only showing up on part of the chart?"},{"location":"#can-i-use-these-indicators-with-a-free-tradingview-account","text":"You can use all of our indicators with a free account, but keep in mind, with a free account you can only set up one live alert and only have up to three indicators on your chart active at one time. With a Pro account, you can set up multiple alerts and have up to 10 indicators on your chart at one time. I recommend a PRO+ account which will give you more than enough alerts and indicators on your chart.","title":"Can I use these indicators with a Free Tradingview account"},{"location":"#do-you-have-indicators-coded-for-mt4","text":"Our indicators only work on TradingView at the moment.
